Options other than [--configure] have been proved working correctly either by my
personal testing or by users testing ACSwitch. [--configure] may be the only one
that needs a little attention of mine, but don't forget others though.

Another thing to note here is that we do not detect whether charger is connected
before writing to the trigger, which in turn can result in many wakelocks thrown
by kernel and actually take up so much of CPU cycles that performance is hit.

Once above is satisfied, I may release the very first completely stable version.
