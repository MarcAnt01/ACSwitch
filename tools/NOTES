This folder contains tools that are used either during building of ACSwitch or
by me personally while developing ACSwitch. All the scripts are standalone and
can be used on their own as long as you define ANDROID_NDK_HOME environment var
pointing to Android NDK, though you may need to adapt some code to your setup.
